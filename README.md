Utilizing the random library implement an encrypt decrypt function. Each layer of encryption should have a 36 unit array. 26 alphabets and the numbers 0-9. Spaces should not be encrypted. 

The function should have two layers of encryption. One should encrypt on random. This layer of encryption should be reset by the helper function reset(). 

The second layer of encryption should be hard coded at your choice. 

Entering reset into the input window instead of a epithet the word encrypt or decrypt should reset the random  layer encryption. The commands decrypt or encrypt should ask for a string to perform the command on and return the encrypted or decrypted string.
